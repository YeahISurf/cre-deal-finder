Premium AI-powered analysis of commercial real estate listings to identify investment opportunities based on seller motivation, transaction complexity, and property characteristics.

## Overview

This tool automatically analyzes commercial real estate listings using OpenAI to identify potential investment opportunities. It evaluates properties based on three key criteria:

1. **Seller Motivation**: Signs that the seller may be motivated to sell quickly or at favorable terms
2. **Transaction Complexity**: Factors that might reduce buyer competition or create unique opportunities
3. **Property Characteristics**: Features indicating value-add potential or situations where perceived risk exceeds actual risk

## Project Status and Known Issues

**Current Status**: Beta (v1.2.0)

### üêõ Known Issues

1. **OpenAI API Connection Issues**: 
   - Intermittent "Unexpected token 'A', "An error o"... is not valid JSON" errors
   - This appears to be related to OpenAI API formatting inconsistencies or rate limiting
   - We've implemented fallback mechanisms but sometimes the API call still fails
   - The app will use sample analysis in case of error, so functionality is maintained

2. **Model Availability**: 
   - Initially attempted to use premium models (o1, o1-mini) but encountered access issues
   - Currently using gpt-3.5-turbo for reliability but may miss some nuances in analysis
   - Premium models would likely provide better analysis if access issues are resolved

3. **Limited Error Details**:
   - OpenAI API sometimes returns generic error messages
   - Difficult to diagnose exact cause of API failures
   - More detailed error reporting would help troubleshooting

### üîß Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Ensure you're using a valid OpenAI API key with appropriate quota and model access
- **Fallback Mode**: If encountering persistent API issues, use the "Sample Analysis" mode toggle
- **Error Details**: Check browser console for more detailed error messages
- **Rate Limiting**: If you receive errors, wait a few minutes before trying again

## Next.js Version (Recommended for Vercel)

A modern React-based version optimized for Vercel deployment is available in the `next-app` directory:

1. Navigate to the Next.js app:
```bash
cd next-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Set the root directory to **next-app** (important!)
4. Deploy with a single click

## Implementation Details

### How It Works

1. **API Integration**: The application uses the OpenAI Chat Completions API to analyze property listings
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully crafted prompts guide the AI to evaluate specific investment criteria
3. **Scoring System**: Each property receives scores (1-10) across three categories and a weighted total
4. **Fallback Mechanism**: In case of API errors, the system uses predefined sample analyses
5. **UI/UX**: Premium Apple-inspired interface with intuitive controls and visualizations

### Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React with Next.js and TailwindCSS
- **API Integration**: OpenAI API via API routes (serverless functions)
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom components
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with fallbacks

## Investment Criteria

The tool evaluates listings based on three main categories:

### Seller Characteristics
- Highly Motivated Ownership
- Distressed or Under-Capitalized Ownership
- Passive or Inexperienced Ownership
- Institutional and Corporate Sellers
- Time-Sensitive Sellers

### Transaction Characteristics
- Short Closing Timeframe
- Portfolio and Multi-Market Deals
- Distressed or Complex Sales
- Encumbrances or Legal Complexities
- Off-Market
- Small Buyer Pool

### Property Characteristics
- Below Market Rents
- Deferred Maintenance or Poor Condition
- Older or Class B/C Buildings
- High-Vacancy or Mismanaged Properties
- Low Floor Area Ratio (FAR)
- Offered for Land Value
- Below Replacement Cost
- Unique/Niche Property Types

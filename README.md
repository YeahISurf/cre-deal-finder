Premium AI-powered analysis of commercial real estate listings to identify investment opportunities based on seller motivation, transaction complexity, and property characteristics.

## Overview

This tool automatically analyzes commercial real estate listings using OpenAI to identify potential investment opportunities. It evaluates properties based on three key criteria:

1. **Seller Motivation**: Signs that the seller may be motivated to sell quickly or at favorable terms
2. **Transaction Complexity**: Factors that might reduce buyer competition or create unique opportunities
3. **Property Characteristics**: Features indicating value-add potential or situations where perceived risk exceeds actual risk

## Project Status and Known Issues

**Current Status**: Beta (v1.3.0)

### üêõ Known Issues

1. **OpenAI o1 Model Parameter Issues**: 
   - Fixed in v1.3.0: o1 models require `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`
   - Fixed in v1.3.0: o1-mini does not support 'system' role in messages
   - Fixed in v1.3.0: o1-mini does not support response_format parameter
   - We now handle these model-specific requirements correctly

2. **API Reliability**: 
   - Occasional timeouts or rate-limiting from OpenAI API
   - Model availability may vary based on your account permissions
   - Multi-model cascade system ensures some model will work

3. **JSON Parsing Challenges**:
   - AI models sometimes return improperly formatted JSON
   - Implemented robust JSON cleaning and parsing logic
   - Added fallback mechanisms for various response formats

4. **Error Details**:
   - We now log detailed error information for better diagnosis
   - Implemented proper error handling for each model type
   - Added fallback mechanisms to ensure analysis is always available

### üîß Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: 
  - Ensure you're using a valid OpenAI API key with appropriate quota and model access
  - Check that your API key is correctly set in the environment variables
  - Verify your OpenAI account has access to the models being used (o1, o1-mini, gpt-3.5-turbo)

- **Model Access**: 
  - o1 and o1-mini models require specific account permissions
  - If you don't have access to o1 models, the system will fall back to gpt-3.5-turbo
  - Check your OpenAI account dashboard to see which models you have access to

- **JSON Parsing Errors**:
  - If you see "Failed to parse response" errors, try again as the model may generate better JSON on retry
  - Consider using a simpler property description with fewer special characters
  - The system includes automatic JSON repair for common formatting issues

- **Fallback Mode**: 
  - If encountering persistent API issues, use the "Sample Analysis" mode toggle
  - This provides a pre-generated analysis for testing the interface

- **Error Details**: 
  - Check browser console for more detailed error messages
  - The API returns specific error information to help diagnose issues
  - Common errors include: invalid API key, model not available, rate limiting

- **Rate Limiting**: 
  - If you receive errors, wait a few minutes before trying again
  - Consider implementing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - Reduce the frequency of API calls if you're hitting rate limits

## Next.js Version (Recommended for Vercel)

A modern React-based version optimized for Vercel deployment is available in the `next-app` directory:

1. Navigate to the Next.js app:
```bash
cd next-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add your OpenAI API key
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Set the root directory to **next-app** (important!)
4. Add environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
5. Deploy with a single click

## Implementation Details

### How It Works

1. **Model Cascade System**: 
   - The application tries models in this order: o1 ‚Üí o1-mini ‚Üí GPT-3.5-Turbo
   - Each model is attempted in sequence until one succeeds
   - If all models fail, a fallback analysis is provided
   - The system tracks which models were attempted and which one succeeded

2. **Model-Specific Handling**: 
   - **o1**: Uses `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`, supports response_format
   - **o1-mini**: Cannot use 'system' role messages, requires `max_completion_tokens`, doesn't support response_format
   - **GPT-3.5-Turbo**: Uses standard parameters with `max_tokens` and supports all features
   - Each model has custom prompts optimized for its capabilities

3. **Prompt Engineering**: 
   - Carefully crafted prompts guide the AI to evaluate specific investment criteria
   - Prompts are optimized for each model type
   - System includes instructions to focus on objective signals in the listing

4. **Scoring System**: 
   - Each property receives scores (1-10) across three categories:
     - Seller Motivation (40% of total score)
     - Transaction Complexity (30% of total score)
     - Property Characteristics (30% of total score)
   - A weighted total score is calculated based on these individual scores
   - Scores are accompanied by detailed explanations and relevant keywords

5. **JSON Handling**: 
   - Robust JSON parsing with automatic cleanup of common AI-generated JSON issues
   - Handles various response formats and structures
   - Normalizes different response formats into a consistent structure

6. **Fallback Mechanism**: 
   - In case of API errors, the system uses predefined sample analyses
   - Intelligent fallbacks based on error type (timeout, authentication, etc.)
   - Keyword extraction from listing text when AI analysis fails

### Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: 
  - React with Next.js for server-side rendering
  - TailwindCSS for responsive styling
  - Component-based architecture for maintainability

- **API Integration**: 
  - OpenAI API via Next.js API routes (serverless functions)
  - Model cascade system with fallbacks
  - Comprehensive error handling

- **State Management**: 
  - React hooks for local state
  - Context API for shared state (when needed)

- **Styling**: 
  - TailwindCSS with custom components
  - Responsive design for all device sizes
  - Apple-inspired premium UI

- **Error Handling**: 
  - Comprehensive error management with fallbacks
  - Detailed error logging
  - User-friendly error messages
